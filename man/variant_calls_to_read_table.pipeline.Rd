variant_calls_to_read_table.pipeline(bam_file, out_dir,
  use_raw_read_table = F, sig = 0.01, debug = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{bam_file}{path to bam file}

\item{out_dir}{output directory, will be created if needed}

\item{use_raw_read_table}{If there is an existing raw_read_table.csv file, should
it be used as a raw read table?  See details.}

}
\value{
path to read table file
}
\description{
Given variant calls and a bam file, create a read table
}
\details{
Converts bam_file to a raw read table, written to
$outdir/raw_read_table.csv and then applies error correction
to reads and creates a filtered read table, written to
$outdir/read_table.csv.   The parameter use_raw_read_table can
be used to skip the step of creating the raw read table, which
is very time consuming.  This is particularly useful, if the
user wants to experiment with different error levels to form
an acceptable read table.
